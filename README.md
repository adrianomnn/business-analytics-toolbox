Problem Definition

Men's College Basketball is the cornerstone of sports culture in the United States, serving as a window to view new talent and to define pivotal moments in the history of basketball. The game has been subject to many changes in the years that have passed by: different strategies, abilities of the players, and techniques applied by the coaches.

In this project, we will explore how the game has significantly evolved from 2014 to 2018 as this was a pivotal era in the game of basketball.This will help to gain insights into current trends. Additionally, since NCAA basketball serves as a stepping stone for players aiming to advance their careers in the NBA, we’ll examine what types of players tend to excel in the NBA.

The findings of this study are valuable to several key audiences. Coaches and teams can use these insights to refine game strategies and enhance player development, while fans and analysts will gain a more data-driven perspective on the evolving landscape of NCAA basketball vs NBA basketball. This study connects the past and present to illuminate the key performance drivers in men’s college basketball.
